## 'Patchworks' by 4 Gamers and Patrick

This repository houses the code for the mobile side of our 4th year group software development project.

Our chosen project is to develop a local multiplayer 2D platformer video game for desktop, 'Patchworks', incorporating the use of mobile devices as controllers. The game is designed for one main ‘desktop player’ who will control a customisable avatar using a standard keyboard or gamepad, and up to four other players who will each use an Android mobile device to join in. 

In traditional platformer style, the game will contain levels in which the main player must reach an endpoint by overcoming challenges and obstacles. Each level will comprise several elements for the mobile players to interact with using their device’s various sensor inputs such as the touchscreen and gyroscope. Interaction with these objects will either help or hinder the main player’s progression through the level.

The game is also to feature a level editor where players can create their own levels in an intuitive tile-based structure. Mobile players will be able to ‘drop in’ to the level editor and build levels collaboratively with the desktop player. User-created levels can then be shared online and rated by other players.
